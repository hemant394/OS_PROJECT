# OS_PROJECT
Project Introduction and Its Features :
Main Aim of our project was to demonstrate the minimizing effects on different
processes. Users can open Different Applications in our modified Xinu OS and can have
a feel of minimizing processes and opening them again. Different Applications which will
be available are Reminder , Calculator , Creating/editing files , Todo List . So using
specific keyword like ‘#’ users can minimize any process at any point of time. And
Users can have a look at different minimized processes by using same keyword ‘#’ in
the main process and will be able to open them again seamlessly.
